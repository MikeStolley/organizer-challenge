# Description

My program is a simple work-day planner, consisting of time blocks from 9-5, and color coded to reflect urgency and closeness to said time of day.

# Code Used

moment.js was utilized in order to create the proper formatting for time, date, etc. Most of the code was done in HTML, while the timeblocks I placed in the HTML file itself, and the JS comprising of the color coding and moment.js utility/functions.
